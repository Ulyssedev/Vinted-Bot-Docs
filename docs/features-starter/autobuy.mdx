# Autobuy

Autobuy is a powerful feature that allows you to automatically buy items with the click of a button. It is available for all subscriptions (with an improved version for the Ultra one).

## Setup

In order to use the autobuy feature, you will need to provide your Vinted token. You can find it by following the steps in the following video:

:::tip Info
Ensure that you enable the `Persist logs` option in the developer console settings (accessible via the cog wheel at the top right) as shown in the video to retrieve the token.
Due to a recent update, you will need to type `oauth` in the search bar to find the token instead of `token` and then click on the `oauth` request.

Once you have obtained your token, you can use the `/token` command to set it:

```
/token <token>
```

You can then use the `/setup` command to setup your pickup points and payment method.

```
/setup
```

## Supported payment methods

The following payment methods are supported:
- Vinted balance
- Credit card
- PayPal
- Payconiq
- iDEAL

## Usage

Once you have set your token, every message will include a button that allows you to buy the item. Simply click on the button to buy the item.

:::danger Warning
Autobuy is a powerful feature that will use the money in your vinted balance. Please use it with caution.

:::tip Looking for more?
If your country supports PayPal or Payconiq, items will be reserved for 15 minutes. This means that you can use the autobuy feature to reserve items and then decide if you want to buy them or not. This will also happen if you have a credit card with 3D secure enabled.
