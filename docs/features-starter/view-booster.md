# View booster

The bot allows you to boost your view count by using the `/views` command in any channel:

```
/views <url> <amount>
```

The amount of views you can boost your listing with depends on your subscription:

- Starter: 1000 views
- Classic: 2500 views
- Pro: 10000 views

Once the views are added, you will receive the following message, allowing you to see the views that were added:
