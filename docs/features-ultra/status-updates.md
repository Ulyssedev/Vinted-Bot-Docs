# Real-time status updates

If an item is being processed by Vinted, the bot will automatically make periodic checks to see when the item is available for purchase.
Depending on the item's availability, the bot will send you a notification in real-time, allowing you to be the first to purchase the item.

## Usage

This feature is automatically enabled for ultra users. To use it, simply head over to the channel where the item is posted and wait for the bot to send you one of the following messages:

- `This item is now available for purchase.`

![Available](/img/available.png)

- `This item has been deleted from the website.`

![Deleted Item](/img/deleted-item.png)
