# Improved autobuy

Thanks to the [Real-time status updates](/docs/features-ultra/status-updates) feature, if you click on `Autobuy` and the item is not available, the bot will automatically make periodic checks to see when the item is available for purchase. Once the item is available, the bot will automatically purchase it for you.

## Usage

To use this feature, simply head over to the channel where the item is posted and click on the `Autobuy` button. The bot will then automatically purchase the item for you once it becomes available.

:::note Note
This feature will also apply to the [sniper](/docs/features-ultra/sniper).
