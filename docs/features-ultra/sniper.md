# Sniper

Vinted Bot's sniper feature will automatically purchase an item for you as soon as it is posted on Vinted and matches your filters set in the current channel.

## Usage

### Enabling the sniper

To use the sniper feature, simply head over to the channel where you want to enable the sniper and type the following command:

```
/snipe
```

You will then be prompted with the following message:

![Sniper prompt](/img/sniper-prompt.png)

Click on the `Enable sniper` button and the sniper will be activated. You will then receive a notification every time a new item matching your filters is posted on Vinted and the bot will automatically purchase the item for you as soon as it is posted.

### Sniper success 

If the purchase is successful, you will receive a confirmation message in your discord direct messages.

### Disabling the sniper

If you want to disable the sniper, simply type the following command in the channel where the sniper is enabled:

```
/snipe
```

You can then click on the `Disable sniper` button and the sniper will be deactivated.

:::tip
It's recommended to only enable the sniper in channels where there is a low amount of items posted, as it will prevent the bot from hitting the purchase limit.
