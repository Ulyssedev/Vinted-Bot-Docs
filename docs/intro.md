# Getting started

This documentation will guide you through the features that [Vinted Bot](https://thebotbay.com) offers.

### What you'll need

- A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account
- A [Vinted](https://www.vinted.fr/) account
- A [Vinted Bot](https://thebotbay.com/pricing) subscription

## Join the Vinted Bot Discord server

If not done already, join the [Vinted Bot Discord server](https://discord.gg/W6MRNaXwQ8) to get access to the bot.

## Open a ticket on the server

To get started, open a ticket on the server by clicking on the `ðŸ“© Create ticket` button in the `ðŸ“©â”‚ticket` channel.  
Your ticket will be assigned to a staff member who will guide you through the setup process. Please note that while we strive to address tickets as quickly as possible, it can take up to 24 hours to receive an initial response.
