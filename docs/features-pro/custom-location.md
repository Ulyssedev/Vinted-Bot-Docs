# Custom location

You can customize the origin location of the items the bot sends by using the `/location` command without any other element:

```
/location
```

Once you hit 'Enter,' a selection menu will appear, allowing you to choose the countries you want to include in the list of locations. Once the countries have been selected, the bot will only send items that come from one of the selected locations.
