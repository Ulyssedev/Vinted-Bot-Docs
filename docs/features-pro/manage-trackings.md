# Manage trackings

The first and main feature of Vinted Bot is to track a given url. This feature is available for all paid users.

## Obtain the desired url

The first step is to obtain the url of the item you want to track. To do so, simply go to the [Vinted catalog](https://vinted.co.uk/catalog), input the wanted filters and copy the url from your browser's address bar.

## Start the tracking

Once you have the url, simply head over to any channel on the [Vinted Bot Discord server](https://discord.gg/W6MRNaXwQ8) and type the following command:

```
/sub <url>
```

## Receive notifications

Once the tracking is started, you will receive a notification every time a new item matching your filters is posted on Vinted.  
_Our bot will send notifications without any delay, allowing you to be the first to see the new items._

# Edit trackings

If you are unsure about your current tracking and would like to make some changes, view the url and edit the filters at any time using the following command:

```
/url
```

:::tip Dynamically edit your trackings

The bot allows you to dynamically edit your tracking. To do so, simply use the `/sub` command with the new url.

# Stop a tracking

In order to stop a tracking, simply head over to any channel on the [Vinted Bot Discord server](https://discord.gg/W6MRNaXwQ8) and type the following command:

```
/unsub
```
