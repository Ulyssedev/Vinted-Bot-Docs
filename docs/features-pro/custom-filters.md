# Custom filters

The pro subscription allows you to create custom filters to narrow down the results of your queries. This feature is particularly useful if you want to avoid listings that contain certain keywords or avoid bot listing.

```
/filters
```

## Available filters

Currently, three filters are available:

- **Location filter**: This filter allows you to specify the location of the listings you want to track. You can specify a country, a state, or a city. This will override the global location set with the `/location` command and will only apply to the current channel.
- **Minimum rating filter**: This filter allows you to specify the minimum rating of the user that posts the listings you want to track.
- **Filter out 0 review items**: This filter allows you to filter out listings posted by users with 0 reviews.
- **Blacklist words**: This filter allows you to specify a list of words that you want to exclude from the results.
