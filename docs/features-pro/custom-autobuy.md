# Custom autobuy

When using autobuy, Vinted will ask for a confirmation to your bank when buying an item. The custom autobuy feature will make sure that the confirmation is proprely handled by the bot, allowing you to buy items with minimal effort.

## Setup

To setup custom autobuy, you will need to follow the following steps:

- When buying an item, Vinted will ask for a confirmation to your bank. Note down the url of the page that is asking for the confirmation.
- Communicate the url to an admin on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/W6MRNaXwQ8).

## Usage

Once the setup is done, you will be able to use the custom autobuy feature just like the [regular autobuy feature](/docs/features-classic/autobuy).
