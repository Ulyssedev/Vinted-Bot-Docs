# Affiliation program

## What is the Affiliation Program?

The Affiliation Program is a way to earn money by referring people to use the bot. You can earn up to 30% of the total amount of money spent by the people you referred simply by sharing your referral link

## How do I get started?

In order to get started, simply head over to the [dashboard](https://vintedbot.com/dashboard) and click on the "Register to affiliation program" button. You will then need to complete Stripe's onboarding process. Once complete, you will be able to share your referral link and start earning money.

## Earnings tiers

The more people you refer, the more money you will earn. The following table shows the different tiers and the corresponding earnings:

| Tier | Referrals | Earnings |
| ---- | --------- | -------- |
| 1    | 0-5       | 20%      |
| 2    | 5-9       | 25%      |
| 3    | 10+       | 30%      |

## How do I manage my earnings?

You can manage your earnings from the [dashboard](https://vintedbot.com/dashboard). To do so, simply click on the "Login to Stripe dashboard" button. You will then be redirected to Stripe's express dashboard where you can manage your earnings, view your balance, and more.
