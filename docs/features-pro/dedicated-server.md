# Dedicated server

The pro subscription allows you to get access to a dedicated server that will be hosted by us. This server will be used to run the bot and will be accessible to you as a new Discord server.

## Benefits

The dedicated server has the following benefits:

- The dedicated server hosting will allow for a more stable and more performant bot experience.
- You can [create your own channels](/docs/features-pro/channel-creation) to track specific queries without any limit on the number of channels you can create.
- You can customize any part of your server to your liking, allowing you to create a unique experience for your business.
