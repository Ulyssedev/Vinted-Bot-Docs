# Custom autobuy

When using autobuy, Vinted will ask for a confirmation to your bank when buying an item. The custom autobuy feature will make sure that the confirmation is proprely handled by the bot, allowing you to buy items with minimal effort.

## Setup

To setup custom autobuy, you will need to follow the following steps:

- When buying an item, Vinted will sometimes ask for a confirmation to your bank. You will then see a page that is similar to this:
![Bank confirmation page](/img/bank-confirmation.png)

To enable the bot to handle the confirmation, you will need to right click on the page and select
`View page source` (or `View source` depending on your browser). This will open a new tab with the source code of the page.
Once the page is open, you will need to copy the content of the page and send it to an admin on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/W6MRNaXwQ8).

:::tip Note
If the process involves multiple pages, you will need to send the source code of each page to an admin.

## Usage

Once the setup is done, you will be able to use the custom autobuy feature just like the [regular autobuy feature](/docs/features-classic/autobuy).
