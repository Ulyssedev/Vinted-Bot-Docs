# Subscription management

You can easily manage your subscription from the [dashboard](https://vintedbot.com/dashboard).

Simply click on the "Manage subscription" button and you will be redirected to the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) portal.

Once on the portal, you can change your subscription plan, update your payment method, or cancel your subscription.

:::note Note
Upgrading your subscription plan will automatically charge you the difference between the two plans depending on the remaining time of your current subscription.
